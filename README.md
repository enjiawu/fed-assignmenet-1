# Laufey's Official Website Redesign
This project is for my FED Assignment 1.

The aim of this project is to create a modern, engaging, informative and visually captivating website that serves as the central hub for all things related to Laufey. It caters to 3 groups of people. Firstly, existing Laufey fans seeking updates on her music, tour dates and the latest news. Secondly, music enthusiasts who want to explore and discover Laufey's music. Lastly, individuals interested in learning more about Laufey. This website aims to encourage users to listen to Laufey's music, purchase her merchandise and tour tickets, become active members of the Laufey community and potentially contact her for future collaborations or opportunities.
