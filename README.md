# Laufey's Official Website Redesign
This project is for my FED Assignment 1.

The aim of this project is to create a modern, engaging, informative and visually captivating website that serves as the central hub for all things related to Laufey. It caters to 3 groups of people. Firstly, existing Laufey fans seeking updates on her music, tour dates and the latest news. Secondly, music enthusiasts who want to explore and discover Laufey's music. Lastly, individuals interested in learning more about Laufey. This website aims to encourage users to listen to Laufey's music, purchase her merchandise and tour tickets, become active members of the Laufey community and potentially contact her for future collaborations or opportunities.

## Design Process
The website is designed to provide an engaging experience for the general public interested in Laufey's music and persona. The design process aims to cater to user behaviours and needs, especially mobile users who tend to scroll extensively. 

**1. As a user, I want to have quick and easy access to all parts of the website.**
- The homepage is designed to compile different sections, making it easy for users to scroll and discover featured content. Navigation buttons in each section also allow for seamless exploration.
